  binary for

## Disclaimer

Unofficial, volunteer-run packaging — **best-effort, no SLA**.

- **Update cadence:** publishing a release normally triggers an immediate
  apt-repo rebuild via webhook; the ~6h scheduled run is the fallback. GitHub
  outages, a missing trigger token, rate limits, or upstream archive changes
  can delay or skip an update; there is no freshness guarantee.
- **Draft releases:** every build is published as a *draft* that a maintainer
  reviews before promoting, so a new version can lag its build.
